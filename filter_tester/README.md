# What does this filter do?
This filter is meant to be used by the filter developer to test the filter.
It compares the expected results with the files generated by Regolith. The
result files are stored in `data/filter_tester/RP` and `data/filter_tester/BP`.

`*data` is the directory with the data of the Regolith profile.
# How to use it?
Copy this code at the botom of the config file of the test project of your
filter and put the expected results in `data/filter_tester/RP` and 
`data/filter_tester/BP` folders for your resource pack and behavior pack
respectively.
```
                    {
                        "url": "github.com/Nusiq/regolith-filters/filter_tester"
                    },
```
The filter will print messages about the differences between the expected
and the actual results. If any differences are found, the test will fail and
the filter will stop Regolith execution.
