# üìù Description

The `json_template` filter is a tool that extends the capabilities of JSON. It introduces a new syntax that allows you to easily replace JSON keys and string values surrounded with backticks (`` ` ``) with the result of evaluating a Python expression. This is achieved using Python's `eval` function.

Features:

- Use variables defined in a separate "scope.json" file.
- The keys that evaluate to a list generate multiple JSON objects which enables
  you to define repetitive structures in a more concise way.
- The files that you work with are still valid JSON files which means that you
  can stil use their schema validation features.

*If you like this filter you might also like the [`pytemplate`](/pytemplate) filter, which uses Python files that evaluate to JSON serializable objects instead of JSON files.*

# üíø Installation
Run the following command in the Regolith project to make this filter
available:
```
regolith install github.com/Nusiq/regolith-filters/json_template
```
When you have done that, you can use the filter in your Regolith project by
adding it to the `filters` section of a profile in the `config.json` file of
the Project:
```json
                    {
                        "filter": "json_template",
                        "settings": {
                            "scope_path": "json_template/scope.json",
                            "'patterns": ["BP/**/*.json", "RP/**/*.json"]
                        }
                    },
```
# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration settings
- `scope_path: str` - a path to JSON file that diefines the scope of variables provided to the template during its evaluation. The default value of this property is `json_template/scope.json`. The path is relative to data folder in working directory of regolith.
- `patterns: List[str]` - a list of glob patterns that define the files that will be processed by the filter. The default value of this property is `["BP/**/*.json", "RP/**/*.json"]`.

Providing the settings is optional. The example above is equivalent to not providing any settings at all as it uses the default values.

# üî§ Syntax

If you're familiar with Python and JSON, the syntax used by this filter should be easy to understand.

## Backticks 
If a key or a string value is surrounded with backticks, the filter will try to evaluate the expression inside the backticks and replace the key or the value.

*Input*
```json
{
    "foo": "`2 + 2`",
    "`str(5+5)`": "baz"
}
```
*Output*
```json
{
    "foo": 4,
    "10": "baz"
}
```
Note that the `5+5` expression must be converted to a string. Passing a number as a key would result in an error.

## Defining objects in loops

If a key evaluates to a list, the filter will generate multiple JSON objects with the keys based on each element of the list.

*Input*
```json
{ 
    "`[f'bar{i}' for i in range(2)]`": "baz"
}
```
*Output*
```json
{
    "bar0": "baz",
    "bar1": "baz"
}
```

## Using variables and the scope.json file
You can use variables defined in the `scope.json` file.

*scope.json*
```json
{
    "foo": 12345
}
```
*Input*
```json
{
    "bar": "`foo`"
}
```
*Output*
```json
{
    "bar": 12345
}
```
## The `K` object
There is a special `K` object that lets you extend the scope by providing it with new variables. The `K` object is especially useful when you define your keys in a loop. It can be used to pass the variables from the loop into the generated JSON objects.

*Input*
```json
{
    "`[K(f'foo{i}', number=i) for i in range(2)]`": {
        "bar": "`number`"
    }
}
```
*Output*
```json
{
    "foo0": {
        "bar": 0
    },
    "foo1": {
        "bar": 1
    }
}
```
The first value of `K` is the key to the generated JSON object,
the rest of the arguments must be keyword arguments. The keyword arguments are passed to the scope of the object.

## The `__unpack__` and `__value__` keys

The `__unpack__` and `__value__` keys are special keys that can be used to generate objects inside a list. They only work inside objects directly contained in a list.

Using the `__unpack__` key inside such an object marks it as a template for generating values for the list. The value of `__unpack__` must be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary is a scope of variables to be used when evaluating the template. The evaluated values are unpacked into the list in place of the original object.

If the generated values shouldn't be objects, but other types of values, you can use the `__value__` key. If the `__value__` key is present, the generated values will be the values of the `__value__` keys. The `__value__` key can be anything including an expression surrounded with backticks.

**Example 1:**

*Input*
```json
[
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "I don't know"
    },
    {
        "__unpack__": [{"color": "red"}, {"color": "green"}],
        "my_favourite_color": "`color.upper()`"
    },
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "BLACK"
    }
]
```

*Output*
```json
[
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "I don't know"
    },
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "RED"
    },
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "GREEN"
    },
    {
        "my_favourite_color": "BLACK"
    }
]
```

**Example 2:**

*Input*
```json
[
    "It's not green",
    {
        "__unpack__": "`[dict(color=c) for c in ('red', 'green')]`",
        "__value__": "`color == 'green'`"
    },
    "Not green"
]
```

*Output*
```json
[
    "It's not green",
    false,
    true,
    "Not green"
]
```

## The `JoinStr` object

The `JoinStr` object can be used to join list of strings into a single string. Every list that starts with a `JoinStr` object is expected to contain only strings. The evaluated list discards the `JoinStr` object and uses the rest of the list as arguments for the `str.join` method. You can use `JoinStr` in combination with the `__unpack__` and `__value__` keys as long as the result contains only strings.

**Example 1:**

*Input*
```json
[
    "`JoinStr(';')`",
    "a = 1",
    "b = 2",
    "c = 3",
]
```

*Output*
```json
"a = 1;b = 2;c = 3"
```

**Example 2:**

*Input*
```json
[
    {
        "__unpack__": "`[dict(value=v) for v in (JoinStr(' '), 'hi', 'there')]`",
        "__value__": "`value`"
    },
    "hello",
    "there",
    "it's me"
]
```

*Output*
```json
"hi there hello there it's me"
```
